# ðŸ”Ž Github Search

Github Search is as project that has been created with the aim to provide a way to perform queries over the Github issues database by the use of multiple fields filters such as:

- Labels
- Languages
- Repositories
- Organizations

The mission of the application is to provide an easy way for developers to get informed about the issues that they feel more interested given their expertise.

## Get started

The current application comes as a _Node.js_ package, which could be installed by the use of `npm` or `yarn` package managers. In this way, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) must be present in the system, and the following commands could be performed over a terminal:

```bash
# First, we clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ProCode2/github-search.git
# After that, we get into the project folder
cd github-search
# Then, we might want to use _Node Package Manager_ for installing the required dependencies, where `i` means install.
npm i
# Now, we could run our application locally by using the following command
npm run dev
# After that, we could browse our application at the URL http://localhost:5000/ in our preferred web browser.
```
